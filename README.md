# Vanta Client
<p>
  Vanta Client is a Minecraft client I started making at the start of February, but I never got around to releasing it because I lost all motivation. 
  It's built on top of MCP 1.8.9 and has code from other projects.

The whole idea behind the client was a really customizable client that you could tweak to your liking. Also if you are thinking if this client bypasses anything, no. I didn't make any bypasses for it except simple rotations that only bypassed Updated-NCP lmfao.
